## 自傳

2016 年，我榮獲陽明大學醫工所的碩士學位。回顧起自己的成長，一直都是新北市的常駐居民。在高中時期，對生物學的濃厚興趣驅使我選擇就讀生物科技學系。透過大學歲月，我累積了豐富的基礎生物學實驗技能。

渴望深入研究生物學相關新知識，我毅然進入陽明大學醫工所攻讀碩士學位。在這兩年中，我不僅在材料及骨科力學上有了初步的認識，更有幸在羅俊民老師的指導下深入學習了幹細胞、細胞力學等技術。我還學會了如何運用程式分析細胞行為模式，以及在 Linux 環境下進行細胞力學的分析，最終順利完成論文並畢業。

畢業後，我於長庚大學光電所擔任研究助理，深入涉足半導體製程和光學元件開發領域。擔任小組領導者的角色，成功帶領兩位博士生及兩位碩士生撰寫新計畫，並於 2019 年成功通過國家 3 年期計畫。同時，我也帶領兩位碩士生參與國際學術研討會 Eurosensors 2018，這段經歷豐富了我的國際視野。

隨後，我在 2019 年離職，前往日本進修一年，並於 2017 年取得 N3 證書(現已取得N1證書)。2020 年疫情影響，我回到台灣，開始在衛生福利部食品藥物管理署擔任副審查員。在這兩年半的職務中，我負責測試報告的審核，尤其對醫療電子產品的效能、安全性、軟體進行嚴謹的審查，並核發相應的許可證。這段經驗讓我深刻認識到醫療設備日益走向 AI 化的趨勢。

觀察到科技的迅速進步，我決定跳脫傳統醫材相關領域，轉而追求可以接觸 AI 技術的職業，並以前端工程師作為踏出的第一步。於資展國際的前端網頁開發班進修，我與團隊成功以 React、Node.js 及 MySQL 等技術合作開發出一個複合式健身房電商網站。結業後於新漢股份有限公司軟體開發部門擔任前端工程師一職，並開始著手邊緣運算機台的產品開發。訓練期過後開始單獨或與他人合作開發專案，內容包含使用 Vue 進行軟體 GUI 開發，使用 Azure 及 Node.js 開發雲端伺服器，並開始接觸 golang 及 docker 進行後端伺服器開發，讓自己的技術漸漸地往全端工程師邁進。

經歷如此多元的領域，我相信我的多方面技能和豐富經驗將成為未來挑戰的寶貴資產。


## Autobiography

In 2016, I earned my Master's degree from the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at National Yang-Ming University. Looking back on my growth, I have been a longtime resident of New Taipei City. During high school, my strong interest in biology motivated me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. Throughout my university years, I accumulated extensive foundational skills in biological experiments.

Eager to deepen my knowledge in biological sciences, I resolutely pursued a Master's degree at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at National Yang-Ming University. During these two years, I gained initial insights into materials science and orthopedic mechanics and had the privilege to study stem cells and cellular mechanics under the guidance of Professor Jun-Min Luo. I also learned how to analyze cellular behavior patterns through programming and conducted cellular mechanics analysis in a Linux environment, ultimately completing my thesis successfully and graduating.

After graduation, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Photonics, Chang Gung University, where I delved into semiconductor processing and optical component development. Serving as a team leader, I successfully led two PhD students and two master's students to write new research proposals, which secured national three-year funding in 2019. Additionally, I guided two master's students to participate in the international conference Eurosensors 2018, enriching my international perspective.

Subsequently, I resigned in 2019 to pursue further studies in Japan for one year, and I obtained the JLPT N3 certification in 2017(Own N1 certification now). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, I returned to Taiwan and started working as an assistant reviewer at the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration. During my two and a half years in this role, I was responsible for reviewing testing reports, rigorously examining the performance, safety, and software of medical electronic products, and issuing the corresponding certifications. This experience gave me a deep understanding of the increasing trend toward AI integration in medical devices.

Observing the rapid advancement of technology, I decided to move beyond traditional medical device fields and pursue a career that would allow me to engage with AI technologies, taking frontend engineering as my first step. During my studies at CSDN International, I collaborated with a team to successfully develop a comprehensive fitness e-commerce website using React, Node.js, and MySQL. After graduation, I joined Ishitoralin Co., Ltd. as a frontend engineer and began developing edge computing device products. After the training period, I started independently and collaboratively working on projects involving Vue-based software GUI development, Azure and Node.js cloud server development, and began exploring backend development with Golang and Docker, gradually advancing toward a full-stack engineer role.

With such a diverse range of experiences, I believe my multifaceted skills and rich background will be invaluable assets for future challenges.
